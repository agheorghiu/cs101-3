    "The code above works as follows: ``bombDetector`` is performing a loop of up to ``N`` iterations (you are allowed to modify the value of ``N``). Inside this loop, your solution code is run first. The function, ``mySolution``, receives as arguments the total number of iterations, ``N``, the current iteration, ``counter``, as well as the first qubit in the register ``qs`` (``qs[0]``). The function returns two boolean values, indicating whether a detection has been performed and what the result of that detection is (for this latter value, it should be ``true`` if a bomb has been detected and ``false`` otherwise). The oracle is then applied to the two qubits and the second qubit is measured in the computational basis. If a $|1 \\rangle$ is detected, the loop terminates and ''Boom!'' is printed, indicating that the bomb has exploded. Otherwise, the code continues to run until either the maximum number of iterations has been reached, or ``mySolution`` has arrived at a detection. The result of that detection is the output of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to implement your solution so that, when ``oracle`` is a $\\textsf{CNOT}$ (the bomb case), the probability of triggerring it is less than $1\\%$ and your accuracy for detecting whether the oracle is $\\textsf{CNOT}$ or identity is at least $99\\%$. In other words, ``bombDetector`` must detect correctly with very high probability and have a very low probability of causing a detonation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this task, you need to implement the ``mySolution`` function. You can define auxillary functions (and even use additional qubits in ``mySolution``, though you won't need to), however you are not allowed to edit the ``bombDetector`` function except for the value of ``N``, that determines the number of iterations in the loop."
