You're going to use the concepts covered so far to implement two quantum algorithms that yield an advantage over classical algorithms, in tasks 1 and 2. Then, in task 3, you will implement another sampling problem that is a candidate for quantum computational supremacy. Finally, task 4 deals with an application of quantum computing that is more speculative in the advantages that it offers over classical computation, namely quantum machine learning."
